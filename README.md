# Excel-Analysis
Three different cases have been used for conducting channel pricing, markup, and break even analysis.

# 1. Footlocker: Channel Pricing and Markup Analysis

Footlocker is able to purchase a line of Nike men's athletic shoes that will retail at $110 per pair for which they must pay the manufacturer $45 per pair. 

Following calculations have been performed - 
* Retail Markup Percent
* Cost Markup Percent
* Retailer Cost Price
* Retailer Selling Price

# 2. SwimMaster: Markups, Markdowns, and Channel Decisions

SwimMaster is introducing a  new pool vacuum attachment that we think should retail for $79.95 at the pool supply stores.  These stores expect at least a 45% markup based on the store's retail selling price and buy from wholesalers who expect at least a 20% markup based on the price at which they sell to the retailers.  The attachment costs us $21.26 to make.  Now, what suggested prices should be set at each level in the channel?

Cost, Markup, Selling Price, Cost Markup Percent and Price Markup Percent have been computed.

# 3. Royal Inc.: Breakeven Analysis

Breakeven analysis is a basic approach to determine the price at which the total revenue of a company covers the total cost.  The same approach is often applied to determine the target sales volume of a product, and the target percentage profit on investment.

In this case, we will review
1) The gross margin concept in a distribution channel
2) Set selling prices and infer the cost structures of distribution
3) Set market share and profit objectives
4) Evaluate marketing strategy: advertising versus sales promotion.

Royal Inc. will introduce its new neon color pencil, KIC, next year.  It is estimated that KIC will capture 13 percent of the 25 million unit market. KIC's retail price is $2.00.  Variable manufacturing costs for KIC include $0.17 for material and $0.12 for labor. Fixed overhead costs are expected to be $950,000 per year. Brand manager's salary and expenses total $85,000. Salespeople are paid entirely by a 15 percent commission. Shipping costs, breakage, insurance, and so forth are $0.05 per unit. The advertising budget for KIC pencils is $600,000.

Following calculations have been performed - 
* KIC Unit Contribution
* First Year Break Even Unit Volume
* First Year Break Even Market Share
* KIC's Profit Impact
* Similar computations are done for unique scenarios which include the advertising budget and incentive programs for the distribtion channel.
